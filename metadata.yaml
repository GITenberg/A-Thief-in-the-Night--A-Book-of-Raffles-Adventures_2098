description: "A Thief in the Night is a 1905 collection of short stories by Ernest\
  \ William Hornung, featuring his popular character A. J. Raffles. It was the third\
  \ book in the series, and the final collection of short stories. In it, Raffles,\
  \ a gentleman thief, commits a number of burglaries in late Victorian England.\n\
  Chronicler and accomplice Bunny Manders narrates additional adventures which he\
  \ had previously omitted, from various points in their criminal careers. A full-length\
  \ Raffles novel, Mr. Justice Raffles, would follow in 1909. It too was set before\
  \ the Boer War, with Raffles in his heyday as a gentlemen thief.\nStories included\
  \ in the book are:\nOut of Paradise\nThe Chest of Silver\nThe Rest Cure\nThe Criminologists'\
  \ Club\nThe Field of Phillipi\nA Bad Night\nA Trap to Catch a Cracksman\nThe Spoils\
  \ of Sacrilege\nThe Raffles Relics\nThe Last Word\n\n\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
